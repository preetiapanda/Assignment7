##Objective: to understand the effect of cardiac events on cost of care.

We performed linear regression to understand the relationship between cardiac events and cost of care. 
We controlled for smoking status, gender, and age.

Our regression model:

cost=β0 + β1⋅cardiac + β2⋅smoke + β3⋅age + β4⋅gender + ϵ


Our regression output found the beta coefficient for cardiac was 289.2 with p< .0001. This tells us that having a cardiac event increases cost by 289 units 
when controlling for smoking status, age and gender. This was highly statistically significant.
